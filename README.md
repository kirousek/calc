# Calc
Basically calculator, but with cooler name

## Why?
I'm bored

## How to run?
1. Install [go](https://go.dev)
2. Run `go build .` or `go run .`
3. Be happy.

## How to use?
1. Input your math problem
2. Follow only this syntax pls (1+1, 2-1, 9*9, 8/2)

## It's not working! What should i do?
### Problem 1 (it crashes after i wrote my problem)
You inputed higher number than 9 or just broke it idk. Just keep it simple :)
### Problem 2 (it returns operation invalid)
You inputed higher number than 9, leaved space or just broke it idk.
### Problem 3 (i did everything right but used divide and it returned 0)
it can only return do full numbers like 2, 4, etc. not 1.5, 4.7, etc.
### Problem 4 (idk)
You did it you actually broke it!
